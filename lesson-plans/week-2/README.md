# Week 2

## Prep Work

- Study `/3-understanding-programs/7-code-review`
- Read through `/4-developing-programs/0-pair-programming`

## During Class

Practice fixing errors and bugs in a program and how to write and review code.

### Before Break

- **All Together**: [Errors](../week-2/errors-and-bugs/1-errors/README.md?--defaults)
- **In Small Groups**: Practice the exercises in `./1-errors`
- **All Together**: [Bugs](../week-2/errors-and-bugs/2-bugs/README.md?--defaults)
- **In Small Groups**: Practice the exercises in `./2-bugs`
- **All Together** Regroup with ~20 minutes left at the end of class for each
  group to present:
  - what went well?
  - what went less well?
  - lessons learned

---

### After Break

- **All Together**: Read through the challenge's specs, test cases & use the
  obfuscated solution so everyone understands the expected behavior.
- **In Pairs**: Practice pair programming by writing a solution to the
  challenge. Take your time and use the `review.js` as a guide to write the best
  code you can.
  - Done early? Try writing more solutions
- **In Pairs**: Find another pair to work with:
  - Swap programs and review each others' code, without talking to each other!
    If one pair wrote more than one solution, just pick one to review
  - After both pairs are finished reviewing, get back together and discuss:
    _What did you do well_? _What could you do better_? _What did you learn from
    each other's code_?
- **All Together** Regroup with ~30 minutes left for each group of pairs to
  present:
  - what went well?
  - what went less well?
  - lessons learned

## After Class

No deliverables. Just lots of study time, alone and in groups. Here's some ideas
for what to focus on after this lesson:

- `/0-flashcards`: ~20 minutes every day (add more cards as you go!)
- Continue studying your favorite online tutorials
- Study `/4-developing-programs`
